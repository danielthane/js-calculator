# Odin-Project Javascript-Calculator

Well here it is! Again I've found myself spending around a day on this project and I feel that this has given me the confidence to move on from the Odin project foudnations course. This was incredibly challenging and made me test out my problem solving skills.

## Issues
The main problems I ran into when creating this project were as follows:

- Getting the calcualtor to work with more than two numbers! This required alot of pen and paper work to overcome.
- Working with some array methods - This is definitely an area I still don't feel 100% on and will certtainly be looking to do some studying in this area before tackling the next part of the Odin Project.

## What I learnt/Practiced
This project was by far the most challenging one so far and tested all aspects of my learning so far.

- Problem solving skills - About 2 hours in, I had the calculator working for two numbers but the method I was using wasn't suitable for more than one. So I settled on two arrays, on for numbers and one for operations and practiced the working on paper before implementing it in code. 
- Working with javascript in particular arrays.
- CSS grid for the layout.

## Improvements
- A reccuring theme here is going to be that the design could be improved!
- Adding the functionality of a decimal point input would be nice. 
- As a maths teacher, I'm not totally sold on the use of BIDMAS here and how it falls down for a calculation like 9 - 7 + 2.

## Summary 
This was a fun and challenging project that has left me with a great sense of pride on completion!!
